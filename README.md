# pyCracker
Python tool that performs various tasks password hash cracking, network scan

Majority of this code is created in conjunction with me reading the book: "Violent Python: A Cookbook for Hackers, Forensic Analysts, Penetration Testers and Security Engineers". Link to the book here: https://www.amazon.com/Violent-Python-Cookbook-Penetration-Engineers/dp/1597499579

I have used most of this code as an excercise when reading the book. I might have made minor imporvizations to what is found in the excercises. Free to download and improvise.
